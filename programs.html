                        Reading and socializing are essential in getting me ready for school. I like to pretend a lot
                        and enjoy scribbling on everything. I am full of questions, many of which are "Why?"</p>
                    <p class="p2">I become fairly reliable about using the potty. I may stay dry at night and may not.
                        Playing and trying new things out are how I learn. Sometimes I like to share. I begin to listen
                        more and begin to understand how to solve problems for myself.</p>

                        learn things in my own way. Label objects and describe what's happening to me so I can learn new

                        direction. I like writing my name, drawing pictures, making projects and going to the library.
                        I'm more interested now in doing group activities, sharing things and my feelings. I like quiet
                        time away from the other kids from time to time. I may be anxious to begin kindergarten.</p>

                        I'm important. I need time, patience, understanding and genuine attention. I am learning about
                        who I am and how I fit in with others. I need to know how I am doing in a positive way. I
                        understand more about things and how they work, so you can give me a more detailed answer. I

                    <p class="p2">I need to spend quality time with my caregivers who are to listen to me more than they
                        talk. I also need my privacy with friends as holding private conversations and sharing secrets
                        is important for my early development.</p>
